![preview](image-3.png)

## Usage

Open the index.html to launch.

1. `w`, `a`, `s`, `d` for moving the object `forward`, `left`, `backward`, `right`.

2. `⬆️`, `⬅️`, `⬇️`, `➡️` for moving the camera `forward`, `left`, `backward`, `right`.

3. `P/p`, `Y/y`, `R/r` for `increasing/decreasing` the pitch, yaw and roll angle. 

4. `h` for toggle whether showing hierarchy or not (hierarchy is rendered as wireframe of bounding boxes, use same color for components of same depth)

## Note

The transformation of component is shown through only apply transformation on the `windmill shaft` and you can see the 4 blades rotate according to it.

## Bonus point attempted
1. Matrix operation from scratch

2. Quaternion for camera rotation
